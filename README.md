# Event-Log-Analyzer

PS1 and EXE are the same app, just different execution. Use as see fit. 

> With PS1 file, drop the file in a location, open terminal/powershell, navigate to the directory, use **Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass** to remove script prompt, and then type in the .\LogScanner_v2.ps1 and enter. Execution policy will reset with close/reopen of terminal window.
